# Weekly Challenge #27 - Mouse Programming

**For this challenge, you need to implement a program that lets you write programs only using your mouse.** There's so much research on building keyboard-friendly programming environment (vi and emacs keybindings) but a lot less with the mouse. This is challenge is designed to put more thinking into this area!
