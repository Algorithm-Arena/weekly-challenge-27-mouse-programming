# Weekly Challenge #27 - Mouse Programming

**For this challenge, you need to implement a program that lets you write programs only using your mouse.** There's so much research on building keyboard-friendly programming environment (vi and emacs keybindings) but a lot less with the mouse. This is challenge is designed to put more thinking into this area!

### Winners:

* The winner for $75 is @thomaswright! Not only can you program using your mouse, but even with a Dance Dance Revolution physical mat! All thanks to using Brainfuck as the programming language :) https://github.com/Algorithm-Arena/weekly-challenge-27-mouse-programming/issues/1

* In second place for $50 is @Uzo2005! Few people realize that most programming languages those days are based on a stack, this solution makes it very explicit letting you code that way! https://github.com/Algorithm-Arena/weekly-challenge-27-mouse-programming/issues/3

* In third place for $25 is @Krayorn! All current computers eventually execute logic gates like OR/AND/NOT... This submission lets you write code at that level in the UI! https://github.com/Algorithm-Arena/weekly-challenge-27-mouse-programming/issues/2
